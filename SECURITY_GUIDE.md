# 🔐 SECURITY GUIDE - CRITICAL INFORMATION

## ⚠️ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

### 1. REVOKE COMPROMISED KEYS (DO THIS NOW!)

#### PayPal:
1. Log into https://developer.paypal.com/
2. Go to My Apps & Credentials
3. Find your app and REVOKE the current credentials
4. Create new credentials
5. Update environment.ts with NEW client ID only

#### Stripe:
1. Log into https://dashboard.stripe.com/
2. Go to Developers → API Keys
3. REVOKE the secret key you shared
4. Generate new API keys
5. Update environment.ts with NEW publishable key only

## 🛡️ SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:

### What Goes Where:

#### ✅ SAFE for Frontend (Angular environment.ts):
- PayPal Client ID
- Stripe Publishable Key
- Crypto addresses (they're meant to be public)
- Firebase config (designed to be public)

#### ❌ NEVER in Frontend:
- PayPal Secret Key
- Stripe Secret Key
- Database passwords
- Private keys
- JWT secrets

### 🔧 BACKEND SETUP NEEDED:

For production, you'll need a backend server to handle:

1. **PayPal payments**: Secret key stays on server
2. **Stripe payments**: Secret key stays on server
3. **Payment processing**: Server validates and processes

### 📁 FILE SECURITY:

#### Files to keep secure:
```
.env                    # Never commit
environment.prod.ts     # Never commit (already in .gitignore)
```

#### Safe to commit:
```
environment.ts          # Only public keys
```

## 🚀 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT:

### Environment Variables on Server:
```bash
# Set these on your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_new_secret
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_new_secret
```

### Angular Build:
```bash
ng build --configuration production
```

## 🔍 HOW TO CHECK IF KEYS ARE SECURE:

### ✅ Good Signs:
- Keys are in server environment variables
- Frontend only has public/publishable keys
- .env is in .gitignore
- No secrets in repository history

### ❌ Red Flags:
- Secret keys in frontend code
- Credentials in GitHub/Git
- Keys in console.log statements
- Hardcoded secrets

## 📱 RECOMMENDED SETUP:

### For Small Projects:
1. Use PayPal's Smart Payment Buttons (client-side only)
2. Use Stripe Checkout (redirects to Stripe's secure page)
3. Accept crypto donations (just addresses needed)

### For Professional Projects:
1. Build Node.js/Express backend
2. Keep all secret keys on server
3. Frontend calls your API endpoints
4. Server handles payment processing

## 🆘 IF KEYS ARE COMPROMISED AGAIN:
1. Immediately revoke ALL keys
2. Check payment provider dashboards for unauthorized transactions
3. Generate completely new credentials
4. Review all recent transactions
5. Consider changing passwords on payment accounts

Remember: **When in doubt, regenerate the keys!** It's better to be safe than sorry.
