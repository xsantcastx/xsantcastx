# Eclipse Realms — Roadmap

The one-page answer to "what's next?". Detail lives in `docs/roadmap/world-plan.md` (the build
tracker); design lives in `docs/world/` and `docs/inventory/`, `docs/economy/`, `docs/art/`.
Reviewed daily; newest review on top of the log at the bottom.

## What's next (in order)

1. **Water, lava, lakes, Fishing v1** — Delve & Beyond slice 1. *(built, awaiting merge: `docs/handoff/liquids-fishing.md`)*
2. **UX follow-ups** — Material Vendor on the kit, Homestead + six surfaces in Spanish. *(in flight)*
3. ~~**Story Act I framing**~~ (world & cast S2) — ✅ shipped: Prologue tab on the goals, the Act I card, keeper lines on the missions, the fresh mark, the act break, the Story tab (`docs/handoff/story-act1.md`).
4. **The endless Delve** (Phase 7) — horizontal sectors, save v2, structures, map v2 *(built, awaiting merge: `docs/handoff/endless-delve.md`)*; next: map pins/waypoints and the Board Herald's daily bounties (7.5).
5. **NPC depth pass** (world & cast S3) — personal names on keepers, act-aware lines.
6. **Art test set** — 21 files (`docs/art-commissions/00-first-test-set.md`). *(owner / image generator)*
